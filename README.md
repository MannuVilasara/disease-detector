- Select symptoms from 130+ available options
- Get AI-powered disease predictions
- Receive detailed disease information

### For Developers

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd disease-detector

# Start backend (Terminal 1)
cd backend && ./run.sh dev

# Start frontend (Terminal 2)
cd frontend && uv run python main.py
```
