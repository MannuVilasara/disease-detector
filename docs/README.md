# AI Disease Prediction System - Documentation

Welcome to the comprehensive documentation for the AI Disease Prediction System. This project uses machine learning to predict diseases based on user-selected symptoms.

## 📁 Project Overview

The AI Disease Prediction System is a full-stack application that consists of:

- **Machine Learning Model**: Random Forest Classifier trained on medical symptom data
- **Backend API**: Flask-based REST API for predictions and disease descriptions
- **Frontend Interface**: Streamlit web application for user interaction
- **AI Integration**: Google Gemini AI for disease descriptions
